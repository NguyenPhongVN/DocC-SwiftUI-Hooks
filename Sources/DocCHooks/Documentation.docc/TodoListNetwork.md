## Overview

This sample creates _TodoList_, an app for creating
and caring for custom sloths.

@Video(poster: "slothy-hero-poster", source: "slothy-hero", alt: "An animated video showing two screens in the Slothy app. The first screenshot shows a sloth map and the second screenshot shows a sloth power picker.")

@Row {
  @Column(size: 2) {
    First, you customize your sloth by picking its
    ``Sloth/power-swift.property``.
    The power of your sloth influences its abilities and how well
    they cope in their environment. The app displays a picker view
    that showcases the available powers and previews your sloth
    for the selected power.
    }
    
    @Column {
      ![A screenshot of the power picker user interface with four powers displayed – ice, fire, wind, and lightning](slothy-powerPicker)
    }
  }
  
  
  
  @Row {
    @Column {
      ![A screenshot of the sloth status user interface that indicates the the amount of sleep, fun, and exercise a given sloth is in need of.](slothy-status)
    }
    
    @Column(size: 2) {
      Once you've customized your sloth, it's ready to 
      ready to thrive. You'll find that sloths will 
      happily munch on a leaf, but may not be as 
      receptive to working out. Use the activity picker 
      to send some encouragement.
      }
      }
      
      ### Localization
      
      Slothy also showcases SlothCreator's localized content.
      The name of powers and food are presented in the device's 
      current locale. Take a look at a few examples.
      
      @TabNavigator {
        @Tab("English") {
          ![Two screenshots showing the Slothy app rendering with English language content. The first screenshot shows a sloth map and the second screenshot shows a sloth power picker.](slothy-localization_eng)
        }
        
        @Tab("Chinese") {
          ![Two screenshots showing the Slothy app rendering with Chinese language content. The first screenshot shows a sloth map and the second screenshot shows a sloth power picker.](slothy-localization_zh)
        }
